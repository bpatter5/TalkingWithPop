Code related to conversations I've had with my grandfather around statistical methods. Repository is mostly written in R with some Python. I'll be placing topics here as they come up. My plan is to add a subject when its discussed so I can catalog what we cover every week. 

### Debate #1 - Ridge vs OLS for regression (nbs/Ridge_Regression.ipynb)
- Demonstration of OLS and Ridge using base R
- Permuting y values and showing effects in both Ridge and OLS
- Cross validation errors using either method
- Fitting time series using Fourier basis with Ridge
